This is my implementation of a 4MB RAM card for Acorn A540 / R260 machines.  It follows Acorn's design as per the schematic in the A540/R260 TRM, but replaces the RAMs with 16bit parts.
It's a four-layer design, using a split power plane for separated RAM VCC.

This has not yet been manufactured / tested!
